# My Recipe Website
This is the repo for my recipe website, which can be viewed [here](https://dwdwdan.github.io/recipes/).
If you have any recipes that you want to add feel free to submit a pull request if you know how to. If not feel free to
email me (or message me on socials if you know me personally) and I'll either help guide you through it or convert something for you.

## Contributing
Contribution must be added to the `_posts` folder with the name `YYYY-MM-DD-Post-Title.md`, replacing the post title with
an appropriate name for your recipe.

The file has to start with the frontmatter
```yaml
---
title: Recipe Name
---
```
After this you have freedome to use markdown however you wish, but you should try to follow a similar style to the posts
already in the `_posts` folder.
