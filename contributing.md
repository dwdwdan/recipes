# Contributing

To contribute, please submit a pull request to [this github repo](https://github.com/dwdwdan/recipes)
or email me at [dwdwdan@gmail.com](mailto:dwdwdan@gmail.com).

Contribution must be added to the `_posts` folder with the name `YYYY-MM-DD-Post-Title.md`, replacing the post title with
an appropriate name for your recipe.

The file has to start with the frontmatter

```
---
title: Recipe Name
author: Author Name
short_desc: A short description of the recipe. This can be written in markdown but try to keep it to a minimum
---
```

After this you have freedom to use markdown however you wish, but you should try to follow a similar style to the posts
already in the `_posts` folder.
