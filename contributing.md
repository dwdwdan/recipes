# Contributing

To contribute, please submit a pull request to [this github repo](https://github.com/dwdwdan/recipes)
or email me at [dwdwdan@gmail.com](mailto:dwdwdan@gmail.com).

Contribution must be added to the `_posts` folder with the name `YYYY-MM-DD-Post-Title.md`, replacing the post title with
an appropriate name for your recipe.

The file has to start with the frontmatter

```
---
title: Recipe Name
author: Author Name
shortDesc: A short description of the recipe. This can be written in markdown but try to keep it to a minimum
---
```

After this you have freedom to use markdown however you wish, but you should try to follow a similar style to the posts
already in the `_posts` folder.

## Recipe Guidelines

The general form should be something similar to
```
## Ingredients
- Ingredient 1
- Ingredient 2

## Method
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

Adapted from [source_name](source_link)
```
with the last line of course being optional.
The short description from the frontmatter will be automatically displayed below the recipe's title along with the author and date.
