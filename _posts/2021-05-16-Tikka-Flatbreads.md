  This recipe came from when my kofta's fell apart - I still haven't made them properly!
  I ended up just putting the mince mixture onto flatbreads and this is what I ended up with
  It's quite tasty

# Ingredients

## For the Mince
- 1 pot tikka paste
- 400g Lamb Mince
- 1 Garlic Clove
- Small amount of ground ginger

## For the Mint Sauce
- 225g Greek Style Yoghurt
- 3-4 tbsp Mint Sauce (depends how minty you like your mint sauce)

## For Serving
- 3 large flatbreads, softened by packet instructions
- Lettuce, Shredded
- Tomatoes, Sliced

# Method
1. Fry lamb mince together with garlic, ginger and tikka paste
2. In a bowl, mix yoghurt with mint sauce, regularly tasting until it has the right mintyness.
Too mint sauce will make it really acidic though so be careful!
3. Once the lamb mince is cooked through, lay the flatbreads onto plates
4. Add the mince, lettuce and tomato. Enjoy!
