## Ingredients
- 4 Burgers
- 8 Tortilla Wraps
- 3 White Onions (or however many you like for 4 burgers)
- Tomato Ketchup
- Cheese Singles (I know this as plastic cheese)

## Method
1. Cook the burgers and soften/start to caramelise the onions
2. Preheat oven to it's max
3. Place a tortilla on a clean surface, and spread ketchup over the central area. You want the ketchup to cover about the same amount as the burger will.
4. Tear the cheese onto the ketchup
5. Place a burger on top of the ketchup/cheese
6. Using scissors, make 6 cuts around the edge of the wrap, about as far in as the burger
7. Make the same cuts to another wrap
8. Fold the edges of the wrap up, around the burgers, and then place the other cut wrap on top
9. Fold the edges of the top wrap down, so you have a small package
10. Put in the over for around 7-8 minutes, until the tortillas brown and become crispier
