## Ingredients
- 50g Butter
- 50g Plain Flour
- 500ml Milk

## Method
1. Melt the butter in a saucepan, on a low heat.
2. Add the flour and mix vigorously until it becomes dough-like, and you cannot see any flour. Cook this for 30 seconds or so to cook the flour.
3. Add around a quarter of the milk (the precise amount doesn't matter)
4. Using a whisk, break up the 'dough' until you cannot seee any lumps
5. Gently cook until it thickens, whisking. You should be able to run a spoon through the mix and it should not move to fill the gap.
6. Add another quarter of the milk (1 third of what you have left)
7. Continue whisking and gently heating unitl running a spoon through the mix leaves a trail where you can see the bottom
8. Add the remaining milk and continue whisking until you have the desired thickness.
9. Season to taste, adding any additional ingredients to flavour the sauce (i.e. add parsley for a parsley sauce, cheese for a cheese sauce).
